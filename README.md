# zfile

A simple file manager written in Rust. The aim of zfile is to be dead simple but powerful because of the use of my own motions that helps navigating fastly through the file system.

## Goals

- using vim motions to navigate
- fuzzy finder
- preview file
- rename, delete, copy, move
- sort by name, size, date
- maybe preview git branch history

## License

zfile is licensed under the MIT license.
